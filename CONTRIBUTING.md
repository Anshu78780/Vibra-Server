## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Vibra-Server.git
   cd Vibra-Server
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Create environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # Edit with your settings
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:
```python
def search_songs(self, query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Search for songs using the specified query.
    
    Args:
        query: Search term for songs
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return
        
    Returns:
        List of song dictionaries with metadata
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If query is empty or invalid
    """
    if not query.strip():
        raise ValueError("Query cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here...
```

### Error Handling

- Always include proper error handling
- Log errors with appropriate levels
- Return meaningful error messages to users
- Use try-except blocks appropriately

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use meaningful test names

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include examples in documentation

## API Design Guidelines

### Endpoint Naming
- Use nouns, not verbs
- Use plural nouns for collections
- Be consistent with naming conventions
- Use kebab-case for multi-word endpoints

### Response Format
All API responses should follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {...},
  "message": "Optional message",
  "error": null
}
```

For errors:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Not Found
- 429: Rate Limited
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use the conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types:
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples:
```
feat(api): add playlist creation endpoint

Add new POST /playlist endpoint that allows users to create
custom playlists with song collections.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(extractor): handle YouTube rate limiting

Implement exponential backoff retry logic when YouTube
returns 429 status codes.

Fixes #456
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_charts.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external API calls
- Test edge cases

```python
def test_search_songs_with_valid_query():
    """Test that search returns results for valid query."""
    extractor = MusicExtractor()
    results = extractor.search_songs("imagine dragons", 5)
    
    assert len(results) > 0
    assert all('id' in song for song in results)
    assert all('title' in song for song in results)

def test_search_songs_with_empty_query():
    """Test that search raises error for empty query."""
    extractor = MusicExtractor()
    
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        extractor.search_songs("", 5)
```

## Performance Guidelines

- Cache frequently requested data
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize API calls to external services
- Implement proper pagination
- Add request timeouts

## Security Guidelines

- Validate all input data
- Sanitize user-provided content
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Log security-related events

## Release Process

1. Update version in `app.py`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release branch
4. Test thoroughly
5. Merge to main
6. Tag the release
7. Deploy to production
